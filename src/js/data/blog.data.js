            "When kids go to college, a lot of them know what they’re signing up for; for the most part, this involves four years of studying to obtain a bachelor’s degree in the field they want.  However, while it is important to know what field of study to pursue, it is important to know what it is you want after graduation.  Yes, you have the degree, but do you know the next step?  If you aren’t pursuing a master’s or doctorate degree, do you have a job lined up?  If you haven’t thought about this, here are a few tips for getting a job after graduation:",

            "A lot of people think that because they are not graduated yet, they should not waste time applying to jobs until they have the piece of paper.  Well, guess what?  When everyone is graduating, all of the spots will be filled in a short amount of time because there will be hundreds of thousands of college graduates looking for work!  Applying before graduation puts you ahead of the game because you will have fewer applicants to compete with.",

            "Some people choose not to write cover letters to positions where they are not applicable, myself included.  I, however, learned that writing a cover letter is not only beneficial, but it is required in an unspoken way.  Cover letters are a way to showcase your interest in a position that is not reflected on your resume.  It has the ability to set you apart from others if you can stress how you can improve a company and give examples of your strengths.  Getting your resume reviewed is also a good idea as it is good to see what should and should not be included on a resume.  I should also stress the use of spell check; it is very importnt (typo intended).",

            "The interview is most important as this is the first impression you will make on potential employers in person.  Dressing professionally is a must here as it will show how seriously you want this position; people would want someone in a suit over someone in their workout clothes.  Arrive 10 minutes early too to show your punctuality, which employers value.  Make eye contact with your interviewer(s) to show that you are actively listening.  Come ready with questions to ask to show how engaged you are or, if applicable, show how you can improve the company.  Greeting and thanking your interviewer(s) with a firm handshake is also important.  When you leave, send a thank you note or email within the next 24-48 hours.  This will show that you really want the position and appreciate the time your interviewer(s) took to consider you as a potential hire"
