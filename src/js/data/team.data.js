I joined SWAG because I wanted to be a part of a community invested in creating positive structures of support for students -- community structures that defy the institutional structures that disadvantage them.",

I want to write about their experiences, their stories, to open my readers’ eyes, and show them the diversity in our society. I want to humanize all the people whose voice is forgotten; I want to put a face to those who are overlooked by society, and show people that they are just like us. Being a part of SWAG To College, has added fuel to my determination, because by being a part of this organization, I have been able to open my eyes a lot wider and see the struggles many students go through when trying to receive an education.
