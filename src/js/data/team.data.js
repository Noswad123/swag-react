      "My name is Victor Hernandez and I was born into a divorce. I grew up poor, and most of my life without a father. I was homeless at times and separated from my mother and siblings. Despite my troubling up bringing, I have dedicated my life to being the person I always needed in my life, for others in need. My journey starts by studying to be a teacher at the University of Houston (main campus) and working hard with SWAG to College, so that young student know that hard times will pass. I know what it is like to watch life fall apart, feel hopeless, but I also know what it's like to build it back up.",
