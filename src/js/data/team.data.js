      "I am a first-generation, low-income student from northern California with a deep love of coffee, couches, and cats. I am also a junior at Brown University double concentrating in religious studies and philosophy, and am spending this year abroad in England at the University of Oxford. I am currently the co-manager of the SWAG Essay Board as well as the manager for the Enrichment Domain. My domain’s departments provide feedback on students’ college application essays, as well as provide resources for and answer questions regarding financial aid and DACA. I strongly believe that the work that SWAG is doing is making a difference by mitigating some of the barriers that students of color, first-generation and low-income students, and students with low resources, face throughout high school and the college application process. I joined SWAG because I wanted to be a part of a community invested in creating positive structures of support for students -- community structures that defy the institutional structures that disadvantage them.",
