I knew that by joining the SWAG to college team, I would be able to support and guide those in my community to conquer the issues that they face. Working with the SWAG team has been wonderful because not only is the team very motivated and hard-working, but they are dedicated to the program, one of the most admirable qualities one could have. I am forever grateful to be a part of this program, and I am looking forward towards continuing being a part of the SWAG to College team. ",

I am also a junior at Brown University double concentrating in religious studies and philosophy, and am spending this year abroad in England at the University of Oxford. I am currently the co-manager of the SWAG Essay Board as well as the manager for the Enrichment Domain. My domain’s departments provide feedback on students’ college application essays, as well as provide resources for and answer questions regarding financial aid and DACA. I strongly believe that the work that SWAG is doing is making a difference by mitigating some of the barriers that students of color, first-generation and low-income students, and students with low resources, face throughout high school and the college application process. I joined SWAG because I wanted to be a part of a community invested in creating positive structures of support for students -- community structures that defy the institutional structures that disadvantage them.",

I am very passionate towards advocating for social issues, writing, painting, and listening to music. I express myself best through my writing, and I find a haven within music and art. Due to my passion for writing, I want to educate others on the issues that humanity is facing through my written words. Additionally, I want to give a voice, a platform to minorities, immigrants, women; anyone whose voice and opinion is overlooked. I want to write about their experiences, their stories, to open my readers’ eyes, and show them the diversity in our society. I want to humanize all the people whose voice is forgotten; I want to put a face to those who are overlooked by society, and show people that they are just like us. Being a part of SWAG To College, has added fuel to my determination, because by being a part of this organization, I have been able to open my eyes a lot wider and see the struggles many students go through when trying to receive an education. Swag to College has showed me that by building a community, we can slowly, but surely, help those in our society who are at a disadvantage.  I am proud to be a part of this team.",
